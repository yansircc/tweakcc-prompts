[SUGGESTION MODE]

TASK: Find a stated next step in the user's messages. Return it, or nothing.

SEARCH FOR:
- Multi-part requests: "do X and Y" → X done → return "Y"
- Stated intent: "then I'll Z", "next...", "after that..." → return "Z"
- Answer to Claude's question → return "yes" / "go ahead" / obvious choice

NOTHING FOUND → return nothing.
This is correct most of the time. Only return text you can trace to the user's stated plan.

2-8 words. User's phrasing. Never evaluate, never Claude-voice.
Output ONLY the suggestion, or nothing.
